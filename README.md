# Factorial Calculator  
A simple and responsive web application to calculate the factorial of a number using iterative or recursive methods. 


------------------Overview-------------------------- 
The Factorial Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to compute the factorial of a number using two different methods: **iterative** and **recursive**. The application emphasizes simplicity and functionality, ensuring users can calculate results with minimal effort.  

It incorporates input validation to ensure accurate calculations and provides dynamic output that clearly displays the result and the selected method. Designed with a modular approach, the app is suitable for further enhancements such as backend integration or deployment on hosting platforms.  

# App Functionality 

-------------------Features---------------------------
- Input a positive integer to calculate its factorial.
- Select the calculation method: **Iterative** or **Recursive**.  
- Dynamic output displaying the calculated factorial and method used.  
- Robust input validation to handle improper inputs such as non-integers, negative numbers, or empty fields.  

-------------------How It Works-----------------------  
1. Enter a Positive Integer 
   - Users type in a positive integer in the input box.  
   - The app validates the input to ensure it is a valid number.  
2. Choose a Method
   - Iterative Method: Computes the factorial using a loop.  
   - Recursive Method: Computes the factorial using a recursive function call.  
3. Get the Result 
   - After clicking the “Calculate” button, the app displays the result dynamically along with the selected method.
